# Gaussian Copula Speckle Removal
This is the demo code for the paper [1]. 
Please cite the references [1-3] if you are using this demo. 
To run the demo please run `Copula-bcgm-master/ main_resulter.m`
* For the shearlet toolbox, I have used implementation by LMU group [2]. 
* For SaS denoising please check Alin Achim's toolbox [3].
* The parts that cannot be shared for any reason, such as requiring author permission, are in p-mode.
* For the Cauchy distribution implementation [4] was used.
